- `Dystopia`:  The lowest scores observed for the six key variables, therefore, characterize Dystopia.
    - Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people. The purpose of establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables 

1. `Logged GDP per capita`:	Gross Domestic Product, or how much each country produces, divided by the number of people in the country
    - GDP per capita gives information about the size of the economy and how the economy is performing
2. `Social Support`: 	“If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”
    - Social support, or having someone to count on in times of trouble.
3. `Healthy Life Expectancy`: 	More than life expectancy, how is your physical and mental health?

    - This also includes Human Rights. Inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status./
      Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression,/
      the right to work and education, and many more. Everyone is entitled to these rights without discrimination.
5. `Generosity` :  “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” 
    - A clear marker for a sense of positive community engagement and a central way that humans connect with each other.
    - Research shows that in all cultures, starting in early childhood, people are drawn to behaviours which benefit other people.
6. `Perception of Corruption` : 	“Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and  “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?”
    - Do people trust their governments and have trust in the benevolence of others?
